  Discussion Packet - Critical Thinking Questions

  What are in the files?
      Instructions, each file has a goal to teach the reader/viewer how to essentially make/do something.
  What is the same in all the files?
      All the files share the same motive to teach/guide the user through a number of "steps" in order to reach a final goal.
  What is different between the files?
      Obviously they all have different end goals and results
     Four of the five have illustrations embedded in the files showing visuals
     They have varying difficulty (seen by the age recommendation on some compared to others)
  Who are these for?
     Average people who have either purchased said product (for files 2-3) or employees (5) and of course the average home baker (1). 
     People who do not yet know how to accomplish said task, and thus need direction.

  Key Questions
  
  What resources do you have available to you in order to be successful in this course?
      First off we have the Book from zyBooks
      Next there is always Khan Academy, very helpful and questions can be submitted there
      Computational Fairy Tales blog seems to have some pretty good stuff
      And as always, the entire internet with the help of a search engine
 What is a paradigm, algorithm?
      The term "Paradigm" in programming and algorithms essentially refers to a certain aspect of the algorithm, and
      allows you to group together those algorithms in what is known as a paradigm. 
      Certain algorithms look to find the right answer, with no mistakes, no matter how long it takes. That would be one paradigm.
      Another paradigm would be those algorithms that do allow mistakes, but only for the sake of getting a faster response. 
      It's like a subcatagory of algorithms almost, based on one (or multiple) attributes that are shared.
 Why are algorithms important to computers?
      Algorithms are there for computers to process, and the better they are, the easier it is on the computer.
      Most of what computers do is run algorithms and thus that in a way is their purpose on some level. 
 What are comments, when do you use them, and where do you use them?
      Comments are just that, a way the programmer can comment on their code without interferring with the compiling process.
      So if the code is not fully clear they can just leave a comment to hopefully illuminate an possible disparities.
      There are 2 types: Single-Line (used by typing // an anything on that Single line after // will not be compiled)
      And there is Multi-Line (used by typings /* at the beginning of the multi lined comment and */ at the end) in case it's more than 1 line.
